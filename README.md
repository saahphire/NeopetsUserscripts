I've made [a blog](https://neopetsuserscripts.wordpress.com) for my userscripts so it's easier for you to find out whenever I post a new userscript! It has a newsletter, RSS feed, and posts in chronological order. From now on, that's where I'll keep the descriptions of each userscript. To find one, just use the search bar and use spaces wherever there's capitalization (so addPostNumberToTopics.js = Add Post Number to Topics).

I've also created [a Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/saahuserscripts.bsky.social) for the same purposes. I hate X and so should you.
